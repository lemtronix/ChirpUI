GUI interface for [Chirp](https://hackaday.io/project/12934-chirp-a-low-cost-function-generator)

# Download
See the releases tags above for the latest stable release.

# Or Build
Instead of downloading the latest release, you can build the Chirp GUI by using the command `gradlew fatJar`.  The JAR file will be located in  /build/libs/.

# Open in Eclipse
Gradle will generate an eclipse .project and .classpath file with the command `gradlew eclipse`

# Run
Make sure you have a Java JRE installed and either:

Option 1: Double click on the .JAR file
Option 2: Otherwise type `java -jar ChirpGui.jar` to execute
